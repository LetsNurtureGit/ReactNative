React Native AwesomeApp Demo
We prepared a Demo app for your better understanding. Go through each steps and follow the instructions.

**Installation**
 npm install -g create-react-native-app
  # or
 yarn global add create-react-native-app

**Clone this project**
git clone < project-url.git >
Install **NodeJS** on your computer.
Install **npm** on your system.
Move to the respective folder <AwesomeDemo> which you have cloned.
Launch 'npm install' command in a terminal opened in the project folder. /*This command will look into the package.json file and install all the dependencies listed here.*/
Ensure a device, or emulated Android image is connected (adb devices)./* for android */
Fire the command 'npm start' or 'react-native run-ios' for running in iOS Simulator or 'react-native run-android' for running in android simulator. And hurray!! you are finally there.
  
 **Troubleshooting:**
*Note*: Each time you pull commits from others, run the **_npm install_** command to install dependencies that may have been introduced.
*react-native is not recognized as an internal or external command*
If your terminal is telling you react-native is not known, try to install it globally with npm: *npm install -g react-native-cli* OR *npm install -g create-react-native-app* and re-run the above command.

**Some of the useful commands while using npm which will help you if you are facing any issues:-**
*npm test*
Runs the jest test runner on your tests.

*npm run ios*
Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

*npm run android*
Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see React Native docs for detailed setup).

*npm run eject*
This will start the process of "ejecting" from Create React Native App's build scripts. You'll be asked a couple of questions about how you'd like to build your project.

**You are all set to go!! Build your awesome projects.. Well wishes from _Rishav_, Team-Let's Nurture**
